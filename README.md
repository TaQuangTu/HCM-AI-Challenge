A contest about building a smart system for traffic tracking via cameras. Get to know more the contest http://aichallenge.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/huong-dan-nhom-1

Following are our concise steps:
1. Use YOLOV4 for detecting cars, cyclists, trucks, bus,...
2. Extract videos to frames.
3. Predict interested objects in the frames, include their bouding boxes, coordinates
2. Read Regions of Interested, directions indicated in json files then predict direction of the predicted objects.
